          <h3>PayPal enable transfer of digital currency currencies to external wallets</h3>
          <p>The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform.
            After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally
            allowing users
            the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other wallets and
            exchanges.
            As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible
            U.S. users in
            the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin .
            BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58.
            In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout at millions of
            merchant
            terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial Services
            for
            the conduct.
            Users would simply need to log in to know their accounts and enter the crypto section of the application to
            start
            transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the
            procedure.
            Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their respective
            blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the
            firm
            generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not
            charge
            fees for incoming transfers,
            The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central bank
            digital
            currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its own
            stablecoin,
            dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the
            source code of the company's iPhone app.

          <h2>Microstrategy</h2>
          <img src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MicroStrategy-1140x641.jpeg">
          <p>Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for its corporate
            treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:
            Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 BTC. As of 12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500
            bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.
            In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy clarified that the 2,500
            coins
            were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.
            The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and
            Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more
            BTC at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.
            The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began
            accumulating
            the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling BTC. “Microstrategy
            plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to
            the extent
            such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a
            tax
            benefit,” the SEC filing describes.
            Saylor said in an interview last week:
            The most positive thing of the year is
            the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is one crypto
            asset
            that’s a digital commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.
            The executive noted that both the chairman of the SEC and the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading
            Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that bitcoin is a commodity.
            Saylor previously explained that Microstrategy is investing in BTC “for the long term.” He added: “Our
            strategy is
            to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going to go into the
            millions.
            So, we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of money.”</p>
